When I’m working on a problem, I never think about beauty. I think only how to solve the problem. But when I have finished, if the solution is not beautiful, I know it is wrong

__Analyzing the factors or causes contributing to the unwanted situation__
In order to remediate a problem, you must first figure out what caused it. This requires gather and evaluate data, isolate possible contributing circumstances, and pinpoint the root cause factor(s) that need to be addressed in order to resolve the problem. It requires Active Listening, Data Gathering, Data Analysis, Fact Finding, Historical Analysis, Root Cause Analysis, Process Analysis and Needs Identification.

__Generating a set of alternative interventions to achieve your end goal__
Once I’ve determined what is causing a problem, it’s time to come up with possible alternative solutions. Sometimes this involves teamwork, since two (or more) minds are often better than one. Based on my experience it is rare that a single strategy is the obvious route to solving a complex problem; devising a set of alternatives helps to cover the bases and reduce the risk exposure should the first strategy implemented fail. Such effort requires, Brainstorming, Creative Thinking, Prediction, Forecasting, Project Design and Project Planning.

__Evaluating the best solutions__
Depending upon the nature of the problem and decision process, evaluating best solutions may be performed by teams collaboration and decision criteria definition. Whoever makes the decision must evaluate potential costs, required resources (i.e. develop and maintain), and possible barriers to successful solution implementation. Effort required, Project Management, Project Implementation, Collaboration, Time Management and Benchmark Development.

__Assessing the effectiveness of the solution__
Once a solution is implemented, have the systems in place to ascertain if and how quickly it’s working. This way, we know as soon as possible whether the issue has been resolved or, alternatively, whether we have to change the response to the problem mid-stream. Effort required, Communications, Data Analysis, Surveys, Customer Feedback, Follow Through, Troubleshooting

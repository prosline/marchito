The software development life cycle is a roadmap for working on a digital solution. It is a blueprint designed for a team to create, maintain, and fix digital products.

While SDLC cycles provide an overview of tasks for a project, they are not a ready-to-use manual. A SDLC is not set in stone: there are different models and examples of software development life cycle. The latter depend on project complexity, and so do the many software development life cycle methodologies. Nevertheless, the core idea of a software development life cycle remains â€“ it is an order of tasks aimed at creating a digital solution.

The key reason behind adopting a clear SDLC is control over the development process. A working plan, conflict management between participants, and budget management are other big advantages of software development life cycle.

Thus, software development life cycle allows for:

 - Having overarching control over software development process
 - Improving resource management and cost-effectiveness
 - Gives teams a clear action plan
 - Improves cooperation between participants
